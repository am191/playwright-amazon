# Playwright test automation project 

This project is used to learn more about the Playwright framework and test automation techniques and practices in general. The project currently includes E2E and component tests for features of the Amazon.com website, such as product page and cart management.

## Key Features
- **Language**: JavaScript
- **Test Types**:
  - Component tests for testing individual features such as product page options (product.spec.js).
  - E2E tests for shopping user paths (cart.e2e.spec.js).
- All tests are independent and can run in parallel
- **Design Pattern**: Implemented the Page Object Model (POM) for the most used pages for more maintainable and reusable code.
- **Browser Support**: Chromium (to avoid spammy behaviour detection during full test runs)


## Test report
Test reports are generated by the built-in Playwright reporter

Full report can be viewed in `playwright-report/index.html` file



## Future plans
- [ ]  Add a test suite for search result filtering feature
- [ ]  Explore visual regression testing
- [ ]  Add API tests (find another website with accessible api feature?)
